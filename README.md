### Libraries and Technologies I used:

- Retrofit : HTTP connection with the rest API and convert meal json file to Kotlin object

- Room: Saving user data in local database

- MVVM and LiveData Architecture: modularisation of the logic of the views and safeguarding the state in case the display configuration changes.

- Coroutines: Background code

- View Binding: replacing findViewById to connect the views

- Glide: To catch and load images in imageView
